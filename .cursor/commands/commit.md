Commit my changes to git.

1. Ensure we're in the workspace root directory (the directory containing the git repository)
2. Check current git status `git status` to see what files have changed
3. Review the actual code changes using `git diff` for modified files to understand what was changed
4. format code with prettier `prettier --write .`
5. Stage all changes using `git add .`
6. Write a short but meaningful commit message that accurately describes the code changes
7. Do NOT include co-author tags
8. Commit
