TODO--->
  1) Admin Dashboard banner and category images are not same by count in cloudflare
      Bug Arises: when we create or update the image, we change the images again without saving it to DB. Cause the image uploads as soon
                  as we select an image to make the saving to DB Faster.
  2) Need to save optimized conversions of the images that are being saved to cloudflare ex: original, medium, cover these sizes
  3) When we visit category pages (index or show) our open accordion get closed cause of React unmounts the component and remount
     so we can move it to a persistent layout to preserve the state
